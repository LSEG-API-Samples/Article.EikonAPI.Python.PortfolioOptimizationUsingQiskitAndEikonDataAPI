# [Portfolio Optimization using Qiskit and Eikon Data API](https://shadab-hussain.medium.com/portfolio-optimization-using-qiskit-and-eikon-data-api-8c684e826cd2)

Financial institutions are testing early use-cases of Quantum Technologies for NP hard problems which are uncertain or difficult to optimize. 
In this article, we are going to make use of quantum computers for building an optimal portfolio out of FAANG (Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix, Google) stocks using mean-variance portfolio optimization technique. Initially we will talk about basics of Quantum Computing and Portfolio Optimization. Later on we will jump to coding- where we will do initial setup, load data from Eikon API, do some basic analysis, implement mean-variance portfolio technique classically and then using VQE & QAOA.
